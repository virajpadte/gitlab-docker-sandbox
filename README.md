Gitlab is an interesting new CI/CD tool I am trying to work with. I am very skilled at Jenkins and one of the reasons for that is I could test a Jenkins pipeline and practice in a docker. I wish to add similar flexibility to gitlab and for this I am working on this project to create a gitlab sandbox using docker swarm.

The ultimate goal is to make a sandbox where developers can specify and scale up runners to use in gitlab and test their pipeline configurations in this test bed without there being a need to unnecessarily use a lot of commits while working on a commercial gitlab pipeline project....the reason being gitlab does not support replay functionality.

This sandbox can also serve as a good tool for folks to validate gitlab for their DevOps needs before they commit to EE version.
